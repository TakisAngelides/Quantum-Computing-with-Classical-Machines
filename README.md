# Quantum-Computing-with-Classical-Machines

This repository is under construction. It aims to use tensor networks to simulate quantum circuits. 

The first file with the name 'quantum_teleportation_protocol.jl' in this repository which is close to being finished implements teleportation with 3 qubits on a quantum
circuit using only matrix product states and operators.
